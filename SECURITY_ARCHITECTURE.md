---

## 1. EXISTING ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES (Previously Implemented)

### Stripe Payment Security
- **Double selling prevention**: Products transition to 'sold' status after payment completion
- **Transaction verification**: Server-side PaymentIntent validation with Stripe API
- **Payment authorization**: Only authenticated buyers can initiate payments for accepted negotiations
- **Amount validation**: Payment amounts must exactly match negotiated amounts
- **Idempotency protection**: Prevents duplicate payments for same negotiation
- **Webhook verification**: Stripe signature validation for authentic payment events

### Authentication System
- **User authentication**: Replit Auth OIDC with session management
- **Protected routes**: Authorization middleware for sensitive endpoints
- **Business logic validation**: Users can't negotiate on their own products
- **Duplicate negotiation prevention**: Same buyer-seller-product combinations blocked

---

## 2. NEWLY IMPLEMENTED ANTI-FRAUD MECHANISMS

### A. Enhanced Input Validation & Sanitization

**File**: `server/security.ts`

**XSS Prevention**:
- **DOMPurify Integration**: Server-side HTML sanitization using JSDOM
- **Tag Stripping**: All HTML tags removed from marketplace content
- **Content Length Limits**: Text inputs capped at reasonable lengths (title: 100 chars, description: 1000 chars)

**Input Sanitization Functions**:
```typescript
sanitizeInput.text()      // Product titles, descriptions, messages
sanitizeInput.location()  // Location strings with safe characters only
sanitizeInput.name()      // Usernames with alphanumeric + safe chars
sanitizeInput.email()     // Email normalization and length limits
```

**Implementation Location**: Applied to all request bodies via `sanitizationMiddleware`

### B. Rate Limiting Protection

**Tiered Rate Limiting Strategy**:

| Endpoint Type | Limit | Window | Purpose |
|---------------|-------|---------|---------|
| General API | 1000 requests | 15 minutes | Prevent general abuse |
| Authentication | 10 requests | 15 minutes | Prevent credential attacks |
| Product Creation | 50 products | 1 hour | Prevent spam listings |
| Negotiation Creation | 20 negotiations | 15 minutes | Prevent harassment |
| Payment Processing | 5 attempts | 15 minutes | Prevent payment abuse |

**Additional Protection**:
- **Slow Down Middleware**: Adds 500ms delay after 100 requests/15min
- **Standard Headers**: Rate limit info in response headers
- **IP-based Tracking**: Per-IP address limitations

### C. Content Moderation System

**Prohibited Content Detection**:
- **Illegal Items**: Drugs, weapons, explosives, stolen goods, counterfeit items
- **Regulated Products**: Prescription medicines, alcohol, tobacco, adult content
- **Dangerous Items**: Human organs, body parts, hazardous materials
- **Scam Indicators**: Gambling, pyramid schemes, get-rich-quick schemes

**Suspicious Pattern Recognition**:
- **Scam Phrases**: "100% guaranteed profit", "get rich quick", "no work required"
- **Fraudulent Schemes**: "wire transfer urgent", "lottery winner", "inheritance money"
- **Emergency Scams**: "urgent emergency money transfer" patterns

**Price Validation**:
- **Range Validation**: $0.01 minimum, $1,000,000 maximum
- **Suspicion Alerts**: Flags items under $1 or over $50,000
- **Business Logic**: Prevents negative prices and unreasonable amounts

### D. Fraud Detection & Monitoring

**Activity Logging**:
```typescript
fraudDetection.logSuspiciousActivity(userId, activity, details)
```

**Tracked Activities**:
- **Product Creation**: Title, price, category, IP, User-Agent
- **Negotiation Creation**: Product details, seller info, user patterns
- **Payment Processing**: Payment attempts, amounts, timing patterns
- **Authentication Events**: Login patterns, session activities

**Behavioral Analysis**:
- **Duplicate Product Detection**: Same user posting similar items rapidly
- **Pattern Recognition**: Unusual pricing, rapid transactions, suspicious timing
- **IP Tracking**: Geographic consistency, multiple accounts per IP
- **User-Agent Analysis**: Bot detection, automated behavior identification

### E. Enhanced Security Middleware

**Helmet Security Headers**:
- **Content Security Policy**: Restricts resource loading sources
- **Cross-Origin Protection**: Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests
- **MIME Type Validation**: Prevents content type confusion attacks

**Request Processing Security**:
- **Payload Size Limits**: 10MB maximum to prevent DoS attacks
- **Request Timeout Protection**: Prevents slow-loris style attacks
- **Trust Proxy Configuration**: Proper IP address handling behind proxies

## 3. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Security Middleware Integration

**Server Setup** (`server/index.ts`):
```typescript
// Security middleware applied early in request pipeline
app.use(securityMiddleware.helmet);
app.use(securityMiddleware.generalRateLimit);
app.use(securityMiddleware.slowDown);
app.use(sanitizationMiddleware);
```

### Critical Endpoint Protection

**Product Creation** (`POST /api/products`):
```typescript
app.post("/api/products", 
  securityMiddleware.productCreationRateLimit,    // 50/hour limit
  isAuthenticated,                                 // Auth required
  enhancedValidation.validateProductContent,      // Content moderation
  enhancedValidation.validatePrice,               // Price validation
  // ... handler with fraud logging
);
```

**Negotiation Creation** (`POST /api/negotiations`):
```typescript
app.post("/api/negotiations", 
  securityMiddleware.negotiationCreationRateLimit, // 20/15min limit
  isAuthenticated,                                  // Auth required
  // ... handler with fraud logging and duplicate prevention
);
```

**Payment Processing** (`POST /api/negotiations/:id/payment-intent`):
```typescript
app.post("/api/negotiations/:negotiationId/payment-intent", 
  securityMiddleware.paymentRateLimit,  // 5/15min limit (strict)
  isAuthenticated,                      // Auth required
  // ... handler with comprehensive fraud detection
);
```

## 4. FRAUD DETECTION PATTERNS

### Content Analysis

**Prohibited Word Detection**:
- Case-insensitive matching against comprehensive blacklist
- Context-aware pattern recognition (not just simple keyword matching)
- Returns specific violations for logging and user feedback

**Pattern-Based Detection**:
- Regular expression matching for complex scam patterns
- Multi-word phrase detection for sophisticated fraud attempts
- Contextual analysis (e.g., "money" + "urgent" combinations)

### Behavioral Monitoring

**User Activity Patterns**:
- **Rapid Actions**: Multiple products/negotiations in short timeframes
- **Duplicate Content**: Similar titles, descriptions, or pricing patterns
- **Geographic Inconsistencies**: Location mismatches or impossible patterns
- **Automated Behavior**: Too-regular timing, identical User-Agents

**Transaction Analysis**:
- **Price Manipulation**: Extremely low/high pricing relative to category
- **Payment Patterns**: Multiple failed attempts, timing anomalies
- **Account Behavior**: New accounts with immediate high-value transactions

---

## 5. CONFIGURATION & CUSTOMIZATION

### Security Configuration

**Rate Limit Customization** (`server/security.ts`):
```typescript
export const securityConfig = {
  rateLimits: {
    general: { windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, max: 1000 },
    auth: { windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, max: 10 },
    productCreation: { windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000, max: 50 },
    // ... other configurations
  }
};
```

**Content Moderation Settings**:
```typescript
contentModeration: {
  prohibitedWords: [/* configurable blacklist */],
  suspiciousPatterns: [/* regex patterns */],
  priceThresholds: {
    maxPrice: 1000000,
    minPrice: 0.01,
    suspiciouslyLow: 0.99,
    suspiciouslyHigh: 50000
  }
}
```
